## _Roulette Simulator_

Made this dumb roulette simular in less than 30minutes. I wanted to simulate the Martingale strategy (idea where you double your bet every time you lose),
to see what the chances of doubling your money on roulette could be.

Starting with an initial bet of $0.25 and a balance of $100, it's possible, but most of the time you will lose. If you do win,
you'll have spent hours at a table or wasted that time on an online casino.

Moral of the story, DON'T gamble (unless it's a lock ofc). The house always wins...

### Using the simulator

Executing the script will provide the results for a single session. Run the simulation a few times with this command:
`python3 sim.py`

To view the results, open the file, or in your terminal, run: `cat results.txt`

Mess with some of the variables in the Roulette class to change your betting size, starting balance size, stop goal, etc...  Run the simulation a few times with this command:
